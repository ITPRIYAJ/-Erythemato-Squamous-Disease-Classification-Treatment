# AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT SUGGESTION SYSTEM FOR ERYTHEMATO-SQUAMOUS DISEASES
🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW
This AI-powered system leverages ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) and DEEP LEARNING (DL) to diagnose ERYTHEMATO-SQUAMOUS skin diseases like PSORIASIS, ECZEMA, and DERMATITIS. Using CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNs) for image analysis, the system enhances diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. It also generates personalized treatment recommendations along with a comprehensive PDF report.

🚀 FEATURES
🔍 AUTOMATED DISEASE DETECTION using skin images with high precision

🧬 CNN-BASED CLASSIFICATION for deep learning

💊 PERSONALIZED TREATMENT SUGGESTIONS including medications, home remedies, and precautions

📈 CONFIDENCE SCORE ANALYSIS to assess prediction reliability

📄 PDF REPORT GENERATION including diagnosis, treatment plan, and care guidelines
