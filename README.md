# AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT SUGGESTION SYSTEM FOR ERYTHEMATO-SQUAMOUS DISEASES
🧠 Project Overview
This AI-powered system leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) to diagnose erythemato-squamous skin diseases like psoriasis, eczema, and dermatitis. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis, the system enhances diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. It also generates personalized treatment recommendations along with a comprehensive PDF report.

🚀 Features
🔍 Automated Disease Detection using skin images with high precision.

🧬 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for deep learning-based classification.

💊 Personalized Treatment Suggestions (medications, home remedies, and precautions).

📈 Confidence Score Analysis to assess prediction reliability.

📄 PDF Report Generation including:

Diagnosis summary

Recommended treatments

Preventive care tips

🖼️ How It Works
Upload a skin lesion image via the interface.

The model classifies the image using CNN.

A confidence score is provided for the result.

Personalized treatment recommendations are generated.

A downloadable PDF report is created for users and doctors.
